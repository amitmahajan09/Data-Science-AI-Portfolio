Problem Statement 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global health and economies. 
Understanding the trends of infection, recovery, and mortality rates is crucial for effective 
response and planning. This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to visualize these trends 
and predict future cases using Python. 


Project Objective 
The primary objective of this project is to utilize Python for analyzing COVID-19 data. The 
goals include: 
1. Visualizing the impact of COVID-19 through interactive charts. 
2. Analyzing the trends. 
3. Predicting the number of future cases based on current trends.
   
Data Description 
The datasets used in this project include CSV files (covid_19_clean_complete.csv) 
containing data on COVID-19 active cases, confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries globally 
and in India. The data is sourced from reliable databases and includes daily updates on the 
number of cases.

Data Preprocessing Steps And Inspiration 
Data pre-processing involved cleaning and organizing the data to ensure accuracy and 
consistency. 
The preprocessing of the data included the following steps: 
1. Checking missing values. 
2. Check duplicated values. 
3. Renaming columns.
   
Choosing the Algorithm For the Project 
Description for the Prophet algorithm for the project: 
I have chosen the Prophet algorithm for this project for the following reasons: 
1. Time series forecasting. 
2. Well-suited for making predictions based on historical data trend.
   
Assumptions 
The following assumptions were made in order to create the model for Covid-19 project. 
1. The data is accurate and up-to-date. 
2. Historical trends can be used to predict future cases.
   
Model Evaluation and Technique 
The following techniques and steps were involved in the evaluation of the model 
1. Time Series forecasting.
   
Inferences from the Project 
The analysis revealed significant trends in the spread and recovery rates of COVID-19. Key 
findings include periods of rapid increase in cases and the effectiveness of certain 
interventions. The predictions indicate potential future trends that can help in planning and 
response efforts.

Future Possibilities 
Future work could involve incorporating more recent data, exploring additional algorithms for 
better accuracy, and expanding the analysis to include more countries. Further research 
could also focus on the impact of vaccination and other interventions.

Conclusion 
The project successfully analyzed COVID-19 trends and provided valuable insights into the 
pandemic's progression. The predictive models offer a useful tool for forecasting future 
cases, aiding in better preparedness and response strategies.
