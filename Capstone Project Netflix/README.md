### Problem Statement ###

In today's world, OTT platforms and streaming services have taken up a significant chunk of the retail and entertainment industry. Organizations like Netflix and Amazon analyze user activity patterns and suggest products that better suit user needs and choices. For this project, we will create a recommendation engine from the ground up, where every single user, based on their area of interest and ratings, would be recommended a list of movies that are best suited for them. 

### Project Objective ###

The objective of this project is to:

Find out the list of most popular and liked genres.
Create a model that finds the best-suited movie for one user in every genre.
Determine which genre movies have received the best and worst ratings based on user ratings. 
Data Description

### The dataset used for this project includes: ###

ID: Contains the separate keys for customers and movies.
Rating: A section containing the user ratings for all the movies.
Genre: Highlights the category of the movie.
Movie Name: Name of the movie with respect to the movie ID. 

### Data Preprocessing Steps And Inspiration ###

The preprocessing of the data included the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Removing any missing or inconsistent data entries.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that might help improve the model's performance.
Splitting the Data: Dividing the datax`set into training and testing sets. 

### Choosing the Algorithm For the Project ###

For this project, we used the scikit-surprise library and implemented the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. The reasons for choosing SVD include:

Accuracy: SVD has shown high accuracy in predicting user preferences.
Scalability: It can handle large datasets efficiently.
Flexibility: It can be easily adapted to include new features and data points.

### Motivation and Reasons For Choosing the Algorithm ###

The SVD algorithm was chosen because it:

Provides personalized recommendations based on user behavior.
Can incorporate both user and item data for more accurate predictions.
Has a proven track record in similar recommendation systems. 

### Assumptions ###

The following assumptions were made in order to create the model for this project:

Users' past behavior is indicative of their future preferences.
The dataset is representative of the overall user base.
Ratings are a reliable measure of user satisfaction. 

### Model Evaluation and Technique ###

The following techniques and steps were involved in the evaluation of the model:

Cross-Validation: To ensure the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.
Precision and Recall: To measure the accuracy of the recommendations.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): To quantify the difference between predicted and actual ratings.

The evaluation report suggests the following:

The model performs well in predicting user preferences.
It accurately identifies popular genres and recommends suitable movies. 

### Inferences from the Project ###

The model's performance indicates that:

Users are more likely to engage with the platform when they receive personalized recommendations.
Certain genres consistently receive higher ratings, indicating strong user preferences. 

### Future Possibilities ###

The future possibilities and limitations of the project include: 

Incorporating More Data: Including additional data points such as user demographics and viewing history.
Improving the Algorithm: Exploring more advanced algorithms to enhance recommendation accuracy.
Real-Time Recommendations: Implementing the model in a real-time environment to provide instant recommendations. 

### Conclusion ###

The project successfully developed a recommendation engine using scikit-surprise and SVD that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user ratings and preferences. The model's performance highlights the importance of personalized recommendations in enhancing user engagement on OTT platforms.
