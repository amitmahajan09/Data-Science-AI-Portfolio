### Problem Statement ###

The company is facing challenges in accurately forecasting sales, which impacts inventory management and financial planning. The goal is to develop a predictive model to forecast weekly sales for each store.

### Project Objective ##

The objective of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can forecast the weekly sales for each Walmart store for the next 12 weeks, helping the company optimize inventory and improve financial planning. 

### Data Description ##

The datasets used in this project include CSV files (Walmart Dataset.csv).
The dataset includes historical sales data for Walmart stores, with features such as:

Store
Date
Weekly_Sales
Holiday_Flag
Temperature
Fuel_Price
CPI
Unemployment 
### Data Preprocessing Steps And Inspiration ###

The preprocessing of the data included the following steps:

Converting the Date column to datetime format.
Extracting features from the Date column (Year, Month, Week).
Checking Missing values, duplicates and outliers.
 
### Choosing the Algorithm For the Project ###

For this project, the Random Forest Regressor algorithm was chosen due to its robustness  and ability to handle large datasets with multiple features.


### Motivation and Reasons for Choosing the Algorithm ###

The Random Forest Regressor was chosen for the following reasons:

1)	It can handle a large number of input variables without overfitting.
2)	It provides feature importance, which helps in understanding the impact of different features on sales.
3)	It is less sensitive to outliers and missing values.


 
### Assumptions ###

The following assumptions were made in order to create the model:

1)	No holidays are assumed in the forecast period.
2)	The average values for Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment are used for forecasting. 

### Model Evaluation and Technique ###

The following techniques and steps were involved in the evaluation of the model:
1.	Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2.	Training the Random Forest Regressor model.
3.	Evaluating the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
4.	Forecasting sales for the next 12 weeks for each store.
 
### Inferences from the Project ###

The model performance and inferences include:

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the model on the test set.
The forecasted sales for each store for the next 12 weeks.
Insights into the impact of different features on sales.

### Future Possibilities ###

The future possibilities and limitations include:

Incorporating additional features such as promotions, store events, and economic indicators.
Using more advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
Improving the model by fine-tuning hyperparameters and using cross-validation.

### Conclusion ###

The project successfully developed a predictive model to forecast weekly sales for Walmart stores. The model can help Walmart optimize inventory management and improve financial planning.
